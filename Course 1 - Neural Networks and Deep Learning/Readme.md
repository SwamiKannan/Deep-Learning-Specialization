# [Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 

By the end, you will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## Course Syllabus
### Introduction to Deep Learning
  Analyze the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and give examples of where and how it is applied today.
### Neural Networks Basics
Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.
### Shallow Neural Networks
Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.
### Deep Neural Networks
Analyze the key computations underlying deep learning, then use them to build and train deep neural networks for computer vision tasks.
