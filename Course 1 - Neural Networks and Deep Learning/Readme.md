# Deep Learning Specialization
The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that helps understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. 

This repo covers the programming assignments for the first three courses of the Specialization:

## Applied Learning Project
By the end you’ll be able to:

•	Build and train deep neural networks, implement vectorized neural networks, identify architecture parameters, and apply DL to your applications

•	Use best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building DL applications, use standard NN techniques, apply optimization algorithms, and implement a neural network in TensorFlow

•	Use strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end, transfer, and multi-task learning.

## Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 

By the end, you will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

<ol>
  <h3><li>Introduction to Deep Learning</li></h3>
  Analyze the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and give examples of where and how it is applied today.
<h3><li>Neural Networks Basics</li></h3>
Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.
<h3><li>Shallow Neural Networks</li></h3>
Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.
<h3><li>Deep Neural Networks</li></h3>
Analyze the key computations underlying deep learning, then use them to build and train deep neural networks for computer vision tasks.
</ol>

## Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
In the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will open the deep learning black box to understand the processes that drive performance and generate good results systematically. 

By the end, you will learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications; be able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.
<ol>
  <h3><li>Practical Aspects of Deep Learning</li></h3>
  Discover and experiment with a variety of different initialization methods, apply L2 regularization and dropout to avoid model overfitting, then apply gradient checking to identify errors in a fraud detection model.
<h3><li>Optimization Algorithms</li></h3>
Develop your deep learning toolbox by adding more advanced optimizations, random minibatching, and learning rate decay scheduling to speed up your models.
<h3><li>Hyperparameter Tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks</li></h3>
Explore TensorFlow, a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks quickly and easily, then train a neural network on a TensorFlow dataset.
</ol>

## Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
In the third course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will learn how to build a successful machine learning project and get to practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. 

By the end, you will be able to diagnose errors in a machine learning system; prioritize strategies for reducing errors; understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance; and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

This is also a standalone course for learners who have basic machine learning knowledge. This course draws on Andrew Ng’s experience building and shipping many deep learning products. If you aspire to become a technical leader who can set the direction for an AI team, this course provides the "industry experience" that you might otherwise get only after years of ML work experience.
<ol>
  <h3><li>ML Strategy </li></h3>
Streamline and optimize your ML production workflow by implementing strategic guidelines for goal-setting and applying human-level performance to help define key priorities.
Develop time-saving error analysis procedures to evaluate the most worthwhile options to pursue and gain intuition for how to split your data and when to use multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning.
