# Deep Learning Specialization
The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that helps understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. 

## About the Course:
In the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will understand how computer vision has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more.

By the end, you will be able to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks; apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks; and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data. 

The Deep Learning Specialization is our foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. It provides a pathway for you to gain the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning to your work, level up your technical career, and take the definitive step in the world

## Course Syllabus:
<ol>
  <h3><li>Foundations of Convolutional Neural Network</li></h3>
  Implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.
<h3><li>Deep Convolutional Models: Case Studies</li></h3>
  Discover some powerful practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs, straight from the research papers, then apply transfer learning to your own deep CNN.
